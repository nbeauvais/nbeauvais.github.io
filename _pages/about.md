Hello! I'm Nicolas, a PhD student working on intuitive and deliberate reasoning and decision-making at [LaPsyDÉ](https://www.lapsyde.com/home) (Université Paris Cité & CRNS), supervised by [Wim De Neys](https://www.wdeneys.org/).


Research interests
=====
My research interests are at the intersection of reasoning, decision-making, metacognition and argumentation. My current research investigates how fast "intuitive" processes interact with more deliberate, reflective ones across various domains such as problem-solving, information evaluation, or explanation generation.

Concretely, this means addressing questions such as:
- What are the different functions of (deliberate) reasoning?
- How reliable are our intuitions? When should we trust our gut feelings, and when should we think twice to avoid being misled by biases?
- How good are we at evaluting information intuitively? When engaging deliberate reasoning, do we improve our ability to distinguish good from bad arguments, or do we look for reasons that support our intuitive preferences (and hence, entrench them)?
