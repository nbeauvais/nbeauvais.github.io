Hello! I'm Nicolas, a PhD student working on intuitive and deliberate reasoning and decision-making at [LaPsyDÉ](https://www.lapsyde.com/home) (Université Paris Cité & CNRS), supervised by [Wim De Neys](https://www.wdeneys.org/).

**Research interests**

My research interests are at the intersection of reasoning, decision-making, metacognition and argumentation. My current work investigates how fast "intuitive" processes interact with slower, more deliberate forms of reasoning, across domains such as problem-solving, information evaluation, and explanation generation.

Concretely, this means addressing questions such as:
- What are the different functions of (deliberate) reasoning?
- How reliable are our intuitions? When should we trust our gut feelings, and when should we pause and reflect to avoid being misled by biases?
- How good are we at evaluting information intuitively? When engaging deliberate reasoning, do we actually improve our ability to distinguish good from bad arguments, or do we simply generate reasons that reinforce our initial intuitions?

I'm also interested in how insights from this research can inform our understanding of environmental attitudes and behaviors, educational practices, and behavior change.
